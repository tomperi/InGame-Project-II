# InGame 2nd Project - Script

### **Setup, introduce hero**
*Scene I - Midday, green forest, you're on walking from school through the forest* 

Youâ€™re **Oli**. A 13 year old girl going back from school through the nearby forest. As you walk, you encounter a magnificent shining flower you've never seen before. 

**Player actions**: (1) pick the flower

### **Introduce Problem**

You pick up the flower, and a second later, everything changes. You find yourself in an "Upside down".

*Scene II - exactly same forrest, but in the upside down world *

**Player actions: **
(1) Try to move - 

> **Oli**: "There's no way I'm walking alone in this darkness"
> (necessary to force the first encounter with the old man)

(2) Interact with **Ian** (hiding somehow)

>**Ian**:
> "Ahhh... turn it off! Who is it? How did you get here?"
> *crawls from his hiding place*
> "What the ... What's your name kid? I haven't seen anyone else in so many years... "

>**Oli**
> "I'm Oli." 
> - (1) "What is this place?"
> - (2) "Who are you?"
> - (3) "How long have you been here?"

>**Ian** (in respect to each question)
> (1) "I've been calling it *upside down* world"
> (2) "I'm *Ian name*"
> (3) "How long? I don't know... Too long for me to count. I've probably been your age when I got stuck here"

>**Oli**
> "How do we go back home?"

>**Ian**
> "There's only one way. You must have a *moonlight flower*"
> "I touched one, this is how I got here"
> "If I could find another, it would surely take me back"
> "But after so long, I lost hope. Not a single flower in miles..."
> "Oh my god! You have one! If you can grow it back, I can finally go home!"
> 
> !! "But we have to be quick about it. There's the **Shadow**, and if he finds us, he will eat us both alive. I've been hiding and avoiding him, barely escaping each time" !!

### **Progress**
*Still the same scene*

See game mechanism diagram for details. 

### **Climax**
As the flower grows, you hear a scream sound, creatures in the frame run. 
**Ian**:
> "It's the **Shadow**! Quickly! We must hide!"

*Ian hides*

**15 seconds timer starts for you to hide**
> - **If you didn't hide**, the Shadow will eat you alive. Game over.
> - **If you did hide**, you may continue

After the Shadow passes, you can crawl out of your hiding spot and go to the flower with **Ian**. 

**Oli**: 
>"You're ready? On my count ..."

*Scene III - looks the same as scene I*

You're back in the real world! 

**Ian**:
> "Fuck! I forgot my hat.."
